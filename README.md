## General info
The purpose of this project is to build a style guide/desing system for websites.
I can use this desing system in order to organize the look and feel of my websites.
Desing systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As my websites row larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users.
It also helps for when i start working with other developers, as i can have a consistent reference for how my website should be built.

My style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to many other areas.
